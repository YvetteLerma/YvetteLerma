About me:

I thrive in team environments, where I can learn from others and contribute my insights. I love tackling challenges head-on. Whether it's debugging a tricky issue or architecting a scalable solution, I enjoy the process of finding the best path forward. I'm committed to lifelong learning. While I'm not one to overestimate my abilities, I am ambitious about my career. I'm eager to work with forward-thinking teams and contribute to projects that have a real impact.
