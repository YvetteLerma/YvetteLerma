About me:

I am currently working on building a firm foundation in .NET framework and C# by working on projects that will increase knowledge in my perferred language.

While I'm not one to overestimate my abilities, I am ambitious about my career. I'm eager to work with forward thinking individuals that will provide insight on my journey.

Outside of tech, I enjoy spending time with my family, deep diving my faith, and making bread.
